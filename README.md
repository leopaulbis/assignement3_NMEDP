# assignement3_NMEDP
Assignement 3: using of finite element to solve a problem in a porus media 
<br> Main1 contain a resolution of the Laplace equation using quadrilateral element (allows to test the implementation of quadrialetral elements with an equation that we know the analytical solution)
<br> Main2 contain the implementation of the resolution of the problem (with and without lagrange multipliers)
<br> Main3 contain a code that plot the influence of mesh size for the computation of the flux
